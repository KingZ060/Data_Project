          Data Manipulation Tool assignment

        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <br />
        In this project I created a converter to convert an image into ASCII art style, it will generate artwork by taking an image uploaded by the user, draw the graphic on a canvas and then obtaining the RGBA of each pixel point in the image. And then calculate the grayscale by averaging the RGBA values to selecte the appropriate ASCII characters to generate the work.. Inspired by the assignment description and computer graphics class.
        <br />
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        <br />
        The goal of this project was to create a tool that could convert images into ASCII art. I am a huge fan of ASCII art and I often use ASCII style emojis (*^_^*) rather than normal emoji. Therefore this was sort of a study of my interest as I felt it gave me a unique visual and stylistic feel with a vintage sense of art from the early stages of digital art.
        <br />
        After I did some testing on the tool I think it's pretty good at converting graphics. However, if the whole image is gray, sometimes it's hard to see the shape of the image because I use the average of the RGBA values.
